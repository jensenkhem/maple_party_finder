# Maplestory party finder

This repository contains the source code for a web application I made to learn the basics of web-development with Ruby on Rails!

The application is currently live on the web at: https://maple-party-finder.herokuapp.com/ (The app is hosted by [Heroku](https://heroku.com))

## Details

I started developing this app when I was looking for a better way of organizing my / my friends' player characters in our favourite game, Maplestory. (And what better way to solve this problem then by coding something myself!) I never expected this application to get as far as it did, and I am very happy with the results, and what I learned along the way! 

The app allows you to create an account, and each account has its own unique set of player characters which can join/create 'parties' (groups) with other characters from other users on the site! It also has a 'search' functionality, where you can search for groups created by other players and join them with a character on your account.

## What I learned

Creating the application was a great learning experience for me, and taught me a ton about web development fundementals such as:
- CRUD operations 
- REST APIs
- Passing information between the frontend/backend
- Securely storing user data / credentials with encryption
- Hosting web applications on the internet and securing via TLS certificates
- Test driven development fundementals
